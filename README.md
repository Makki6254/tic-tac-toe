The C++ program implements a console-based Tic Tac Toe game where two players, 'X' and 'O,' take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The game initializes with an empty board and prompts players for row and column numbers to place their symbols. Input validation ensures moves are within the valid range and placed in empty cells. After each move, the program checks for a win or a tie, breaking the game loop when either condition is met. The player symbols alternate, and the program provides error messages for invalid moves. Overall, the code offers a clear and organized implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game with simple and understandable gameplay in the console.
